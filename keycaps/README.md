# Original keycaps

The files in here are original, uncut keycaps.

## Chicago Stenographer

The popular Chicago Stenographer keycaps in the commonly used variations.

You can find more info on [asymplex.xyz, the creator's homepage where you can order full keysets](https://www.asymplex.xyz).

You can also check [their original github repo](https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) with the code or my fork with sprued keycaps and JLCPCB printing instructions.

## MBK

These files are a reproduction of the popular MBK keycaps for rendering purposes.They are not the original production files, so printing them will not produce keycaps exactly like production versions.

They are close, but not exact.

Dowloaded from here:

One person in the thingiverse comments mentioned that printing them works and that they fit. So it's worth a try.
