# Trackpoint Keycap STLs

## About the keycaps

This repo has Chicago Stenographer and MBK keycaps with cutouts for a trackpoint.

To understand how to use the different variations of Chicago Steno, [check my fork of those keycaps](https://github.com/infused-kim/kb_keycaps_chicago_stenographer).

The MBK keycaps are not really meant to be printed, so you should buy the rest of the keycaps at one of the many vendors that sell them.

## Where are the STLs?

To keep the repo small, the stls can be found in the [repo's releases section](../../../releases/).
